## About Thi Lan Anh Tran

I’m a student in **ETC5523 – Communicating with Data** at Monash University, focused on turning complex datasets into clear stories that help people make better decisions. I work primarily in **R (tidyverse)** with **Quarto** and **GitHub** for fully reproducible analysis.

My current interests include:
- **Data wrangling & visualisation** (ggplot2, plotly, shiny for interactive explainers)  
- **Evidence storytelling** for social & economic questions  
- **Reproducible research** (Quarto sites, parameterised reports, clean project structure)

I value communication that is visually clean, statistically honest, and audience-appropriate.
